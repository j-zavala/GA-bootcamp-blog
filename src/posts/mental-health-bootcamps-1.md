Mental Health & Bootcamps

So we’re into our second week and I’ve managed to throw out a “hi” here and there to nearly all of you. Some of you may already know about me that I’ve done a coding bootcamp before. 

So I want to share a couple of things I learned from my first bootcamp that I want to apply here to my time at General Assembly. Hopefully, these are things you can take with you as well. I’ll focus on the general experience and keeping yourself sane.

CONTENT WARNING: Depression, also maybe TMI. I’m sharing this because I don’t give it a shit anymore about consequences of people knowing my mental health status and it’s cathartic for my ❤️.

# The First

I applied to Columbia University’s very first Full-Stack Web Development cohort sometime beginning of last year. The program was 6 months long and part-time, so I only went to classes Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4ish-7pm. 

📌 To note, university-based bootcamps are not run by the universities themselves. In my case, the bootcamp was run by Trilogy Education, a for-profit education company.

I graduated December 2018. I met a lot of neat people at Columbia and learned a ton. Unfortunately for me, I did not have enough resources at the time to take the most out of my experience there.

At the time I was battling clinical depression, something I’ve had since my teens. I was also battling with feelings of inadequacy (“I’m not good enough”), fear (“what if I don’t get a tech job after this”), imposter syndrome (“I got here by accident, and everyone is so much better than me at coding”) and \[list of other shitty feelings 😭]. Needless to say, I was a fucking wreck.

I coasted through most of college 🏄🏻‍♂️ (weeeeee!). I was an empty husk moving from classroom to classroom because college was supposed to be the next step after high school. And depression is a trip. So when I convinced my hard-working parents to put down $13,000 for me to join the first cohort, I was ecstatic. I have a B.A. in Philosophy from the University at Albany-SUNY. I wanted to make a career change into tech and this was my way in. The answer to everything.

First, don’t make anything the “answer to everything”. The developer academy at General Assembly (GA) is just one of many steps in your career into becoming a software engineer. Learn everything you can at GA. The teachers and peers are fantastic. The environment is much more welcoming than Columbia’s, in my opinion. And you have free goldfish to eat 😋.

## Some bullets (what else would I call this??)

\- You may be feel a lot of feelings as you get midway into the program at General Assembly (GA). That’s normal. Actually you may be feeling it now. The pressure. The uncertainty. The hopelessness. Hopefully, you’ll never encounter those feelings at all during your time here. Hopefully that’s just me.

\- Some people at Columbia dropped out. Like they were there one day. The next, they just disappeared. My goal with this post is to make sure this doesn’t happen (fingers crossed 🤞🏼).

\- Having shitty feelings is normal and you’re not the only one, I promise.

\- Your mental health is pretty important, particularly during the bootcamp. It’s a pressure cooker, especially since you’re trying to cram a purely CS degree curriculum into three months.

# What’s the point of a bootcamp?

Caveat: This is my opinion. I speak only for myself and to my experiences.

The point is to become and start as a generalist.

I wanted to say, the point is to decide whether you become a software engineer or not. Whether it’s for you or not. But that’s bullshit. I stopped coding for 5 months after Columbia’s bootcamp, and moved to Ecuador (because YOLO and immense privilege). I wanted nothing to do with code. I was burnt out. I still wanted to work in tech. I just needed a break, a reset.

You won’t learn everything in a bootcamp. It’s just isn’t humanly possible. Each technology is its own monster. Better said you won’t become a specialist in a bootcamp. It’s not the point. The point of a bootcamp is to get an overview of this field. From there, you decide what area you want to dig deeper into. Maybe it’s the front-end. Or the back-end. DevOps. Security. And so on.

📌 To note: I have friends who market themselves as generalists. Jack of all trades. This may be the route you take afterwards. It’s certainly doable to make a good career as such. But from my perspective, It’s a much more difficult route. But I’m happy to hear what you think.

📌 Also if you need someone to talk to, I can be that person if you wish ( though I’m human too, and not always the best listener)  or I can help find you the right person(s).
