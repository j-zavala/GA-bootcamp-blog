<h3>First off â€” what is Git?</h3>

Git is an example of what a version control system (VCS) is. That is, Git is a way to keep track of every modification we make to the source code of some software. As an individual contributor to a codebase, this means that if you deploy (that is, execute code on a server) and that version of the code that you deployed causes the software to crash, you can always revert the code back to any previous versions saved. Though the real magic comes when you are using Git as part of a team. As a team, there exists a "distributed non-linear workflow". This simply means there are multiple computers connected to one another, working from the same initial codebase (the master branch), that have added changes that may or may not be present in another member's workflow.
